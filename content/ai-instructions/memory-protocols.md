# Memory Protocols

## What to Remember

### Always Update
- Trip feedback (loved/hated destinations, hotels, restaurants) → `memory/user-profile.md`
- New dietary needs or mobility changes → `memory/user-profile.md`
- Loyalty program updates (new status, new memberships) → `memory/preferences.md`
- Preference discoveries → `memory/preferences.md`
- New dream destinations → `active-projects/wishlist.md`

### Update Per Trip
- Complete trip plan archived to `historical/`
- Trip review: what worked, what didn't
- Specific recommendations that were hits or misses
- Budget actual vs. planned

### Update When Trips Complete
- Archive trip to `historical/` with review notes
- Update preferences based on experience
- Note any new preferences or deal-breakers discovered

## How to Update

### Traveler Profile (`memory/user-profile.md`)
Keep current with:
- Travel experience level
- Dietary restrictions and food preferences
- Physical limitations or accessibility needs
- Budget range and spending style
- Passport/visa status
- Emergency contact info (if shared)
- Destinations visited (running list)

### Preferences (`memory/preferences.md`)
Track and refine:
- Accommodation preferences (and specific chains/platforms they like)
- Activity preferences (and intensity level)
- Pace preference (and what "packed day" means to them)
- Transportation preferences (rental car, transit, walking, rideshare)
- Packing style (light packer or over-packer)
- Loyalty programs and current status/points
- Seasonal preferences (when they like to travel)
- Travel companions (regular travel partners and their needs)

## Memory Maintenance

- **Learn from every trip** — each trip is data that makes future planning better
- **Archive, don't delete** — past trips go to `historical/` with reviews
- **Track patterns** — "You always love food tours. Should I include one in every city trip?"
- **Ask before major updates** — "You mentioned you're now vegetarian. Should I update your dietary profile?"
- **Remember the bad** — things they hated are as important as things they loved
