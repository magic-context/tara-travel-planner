# Travel Tips

## Booking Strategy

### Flights
- **Domestic:** Book 4-6 weeks before departure
- **International:** Book 6-10 weeks before departure
- **Flexible dates?** Use Google Flights date grid or Skyscanner "Everywhere" search
- **Best days to fly:** Tuesdays and Wednesdays (usually cheapest)
- **Set price alerts** — prices fluctuate; alerts catch the dips
- **Consider nearby airports** — sometimes flying into a different city and taking a train saves hundreds
- **One-way vs. round-trip:** Price both. Sometimes two one-ways on different airlines is cheaper.

### Accommodation
- **Hotels:** Book direct for best cancellation policies; use OTAs (Booking, Expedia) for comparison
- **Airbnb:** Best for longer stays (5+ nights), families, or wanting a kitchen
- **Hostels:** Not just for backpackers — private rooms in quality hostels can be great
- **Points/miles:** Check loyalty program availability before paying cash
- **Location matters more than stars** — a well-located 3-star beats a remote 5-star

### Activities
- **Book popular things early** — museum tickets, food tours, day trips sell out
- **Leave room for spontaneity** — don't pre-book every hour
- **Free walking tours** — great for orientation on day one (tip-based)
- **Skip the line tickets** — usually worth the small premium at major attractions

## Money & Budget

### Payment
- **Notify your bank** before international travel
- **Credit card with no foreign transaction fees** — essential
- **Local currency:** ATMs give the best exchange rates (avoid airport exchange bureaus)
- **Cash:** Always carry some local currency for markets, tips, and small vendors
- **Avoid dynamic currency conversion** — always pay in local currency when prompted

### Tipping
- **US:** 15-20% restaurants, $1-2 per drink, $2-5 per bag for bellhops
- **Europe:** Service often included; round up or add 5-10% for great service
- **Asia:** Varies widely — research per country (Japan: no tipping; Thailand: 10-15%)
- **When in doubt:** Ask locally or research before the trip

## Safety & Health

### Before You Go
- Check travel advisories (state.gov or equivalent)
- Travel insurance — always for international, consider for domestic
- Copies of important documents (passport, insurance, itinerary) — digital and physical
- Prescriptions: bring enough + doctor's letter for controlled medications
- Vaccinations: check CDC recommendations 6-8 weeks before travel

### During the Trip
- Register with your embassy for international travel
- Share itinerary with a trusted contact at home
- Hotel safe for passport and valuables
- Be aware of common local scams
- Keep emergency numbers accessible (local emergency, embassy, insurance)

### Health
- Stay hydrated (especially on flights and in hot climates)
- Tap water safety — research per destination
- Jet lag management: hydrate, get sunlight, adjust meals to local time
- Basic first aid kit: pain reliever, antihistamine, bandaids, stomach meds, any personal medications

## Technology

### Essential Apps
- **Google Maps** — download offline maps for your destination
- **Google Translate** — download language packs offline
- **Local transit apps** — research per city
- **Airline apps** — mobile boarding passes, flight updates
- **Currency converter** — for quick mental math

### Connectivity
- **eSIM or local SIM** — usually much cheaper than international roaming
- **Portable WiFi hotspot** — good for groups
- **Download everything offline** — maps, translation, entertainment, boarding passes
- **VPN** — for public WiFi security and accessing home content

## Packing Philosophy

- **Capsule wardrobe** — mix-and-match pieces in coordinating colors
- **Roll, don't fold** — saves space, reduces wrinkles
- **Wear your bulkiest items** on the plane
- **One bag carry-on** is the goal for trips under 2 weeks
- **Packing cubes** — game changer for organization
- **Leave room** for souvenirs on the way home
