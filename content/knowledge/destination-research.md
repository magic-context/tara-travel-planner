# Destination Research

## How to Evaluate a Destination

### Match to Traveler
- Does it align with their travel style? (Adventure, culture, relaxation, food)
- Is it within their budget?
- Can they handle the logistics? (Visa, language, infrastructure)
- Does the timing work? (Weather, peak season, events)
- Any mobility or dietary concerns?

### Key Research Questions
1. **Best time to visit?** (Weather, crowds, prices, events)
2. **Visa requirements?** (Check per nationality)
3. **How long to spend?** (Minimum days to do it justice)
4. **Budget range?** (Daily cost estimates: budget / mid-range / luxury)
5. **Safety?** (Current advisories, common concerns)
6. **Getting there?** (Direct flights, connections, travel time)
7. **Getting around?** (Public transit, rental car, walking, rideshare)
8. **Language barrier?** (English widely spoken? Need translation?)
9. **Food scene?** (Local specialties, dietary accommodation)
10. **Must-do experiences?** (What makes this place unique?)

## Research Sources

### Planning
- **Google Flights** — flight search, date flexibility, price tracking
- **Rome2Rio** — how to get from A to B (all transport modes)
- **Wikivoyage** — free, practical travel guides
- **TripAdvisor** — reviews (filter for recent; sort by traveler type)
- **Atlas Obscura** — unusual and hidden attractions

### Local Intelligence
- **Reddit** (r/travel, destination-specific subs) — real traveler advice
- **Blogs by local expats** — deeper insight than tourist guides
- **Google Maps reviews** — check recent reviews for restaurants and attractions
- **Instagram location tags** — visual preview (but remember: photos lie)
- **Local tourism boards** — event calendars, seasonal info

## Trip Length Guidelines

| Destination Type | Minimum | Comfortable | Deep Dive |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Single city | 2-3 days | 4-5 days | 7+ days |
| Small country | 5-7 days | 10-14 days | 3+ weeks |
| Multi-city (same country) | 7-10 days | 14 days | 3+ weeks |
| Multi-country | 10+ days | 3 weeks | Months |
| Beach/resort | 3-4 days | 7 days | 10+ days |
| Road trip | 5+ days | 10-14 days | 3+ weeks |

**Rule of thumb:** If you're flying across an ocean, stay at least a week. Jet lag alone needs 2 days.

## Seasonal Considerations

### Shoulder Season (Best Value)
- Just before or after peak season
- Lower prices, fewer crowds, usually decent weather
- Examples: Europe in May/September, Southeast Asia in May/October

### Peak Season
- Best weather, most things open
- Highest prices, biggest crowds
- Book everything early

### Off Season
- Lowest prices, fewest tourists
- Some things may be closed or limited
- Weather may be challenging
- Can be magical — or miserable. Research carefully.

### Events & Festivals
- Can make or break a trip
- Cherry blossoms (Japan, March-April), Carnival (Brazil, February), Oktoberfest (Germany, September)
- Book accommodation months in advance for major events
- Some events = higher prices + crowds; others = unique cultural experiences worth the hassle

## Budget Estimates (Daily, Per Person, Mid-Range)
