- **Roll soft items, fold structured items** — saves space
- **Wear bulkiest items** on travel day
- **Outfit planning:** Lay out complete outfits, then edit down
- **Liquids:** 3-1-1 rule for carry-on (3.4oz containers, 1 quart bag, 1 per person)
- **Dirty laundry bag** — separate clean from worn
- **Leave 20% empty** for souvenirs and purchases on the return
