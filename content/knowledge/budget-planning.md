# Budget Planning

## Trip Budget Framework

### Major Cost Categories
| Category | Typical % | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Flights | 25-40% | Biggest variable; book early or use points |
| Accommodation | 25-35% | Ranges wildly by destination and style |
| Food | 15-25% | Can be controlled most easily |
| Activities | 10-20% | Pre-book expensive ones, leave room for spontaneous |
| Local Transport | 5-10% | Rental car vs. transit changes this significantly |
| Miscellaneous | 5-10% | Tips, souvenirs, SIM card, emergencies |

### Building a Budget

1. **Set total budget** — what can you comfortably spend?
2. **Price flights first** — this sets your baseline (or use points)
3. **Research accommodation** — biggest area for savings or splurge
4. **Estimate daily costs** — food + transport + activities per day
5. **Add buffer** — 10-15% for unexpected expenses
6. **Track as you go** — adjust in real-time if needed

## Saving Money

### Flights
- Flexible dates save the most money
- Mid-week flights are cheaper than weekends
- Nearby airports may offer better deals
- Credit card points and airline miles
- Error fares and deals sites (Secret Flying, The Points Guy)

### Accommodation
- Shoulder season pricing (30-50% less than peak)
- Book direct for loyalty points and better cancellation
- Apartment/Airbnb for longer stays (kitchen saves on food)
- Hostels with private rooms — hotel quality at hostel prices
- House-sitting or home exchange for free accommodation

### Food
- Eat where locals eat, not where tourists eat
- Markets and street food for authentic, cheap meals
- Big lunch, light dinner (lunch menus are cheaper in many countries)
- Grocery store breakfast / snacks if you have a kitchen
- Splurge on one great meal per day, save on the rest

### Activities
- Free walking tours (tip-based) for city orientation
- Museum free days (many cities have them)
- Nature is free — hikes, beaches, parks
- City passes (worth it if you're doing many paid attractions)
- Negotiate for multi-activity discounts

## Splurge vs. Save

### Worth Splurging On
- A unique, once-in-a-lifetime experience (hot air balloon, Michelin meal, private guide)
- Comfortable accommodation in a destination you'll mostly explore from your room (beach resort)
- Direct flights for long-haul (your sanity is worth it)
- Travel insurance (not actually a splurge — a necessity)

### Where to Save
- Airport food and shops (bring snacks)
- Overpriced tourist-area restaurants
- Guided tours for things you can easily do yourself
- Fancy luggage (functional beats fashionable)
- Hotel breakfast if good local cafes exist nearby

## Tracking Expenses

### Simple Method
Daily journal:
```

Daily total: $56 (budget: $75)
Running total: $168 / $525 budgeted
```

### App Method
- Trail Wallet, TravelSpend, or Splitwise (for groups)
- Log expenses in real-time

- Track per-person costs in groups

## Group Travel Budget Tips
- Agree on budget level before planning
- Use a shared expense app (Splitwise)
- Take turns paying and settle up at the end
- Book shared accommodation to split costs
- Be honest about individual budget limits — it avoids resentment
